## Introduction
> Prosper Loan Data is a dataset that contains information about 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and various other variables, this is one of the most varied dataset I found which contains information on topics that are closely related as well as not so much, it can be used for studying tons of trends in the loan business, which is one of the reasons why I picked this dataset.
